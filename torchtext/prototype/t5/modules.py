    Translate relative position to a bucket number for relative attention. The relative position is defined as
    memory_position - query_position, i.e. the distance in tokens from the attending position to the attended-to
    position. If bidirectional=False, then positive relative positions are invalid. We use smaller buckets for
    small absolute relative_position and larger buckets for larger absolute relative_positions. All relative
    positions >=max_distance map to the same bucket. All relative positions <=-max_distance map to the same bucket.
    This should allow for more graceful generalization to longer sequences than the model has been trained on
    Args:
        relative_position: an int32 Tensor
        bidirectional: a boolean - whether the attention is bidirectional
        num_buckets: an integer
        max_distance: an integer
    Returns:
        a Tensor with the same shape as relative_position, containing int32 values in the range [0, num_buckets)
